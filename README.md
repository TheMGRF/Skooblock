# Skooblock
"A fully fledged, feature rich custom Skyblock experience!"

### Description
SkooBlock is an old project I've decided to open-source for others, its by no means perfect and I've made more optimised
versions since, but it represents the lot of time, effort, and work that went into it. It's designed to work with
[WorldEdit](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldedit) and [Vault](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/)
for [Paper Minecraft 1.15.2](https://papermc.io/).

SkooBlock has a small API that can be accessed by the SkooBlock class.

SkooBlock was originally created for use on the [Indigo Games](https://indigo.games) network owned by
[Indigo Studios](https://indigostudios.ltd) but was cancelled shortly before the closure of the server.
